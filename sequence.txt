Page loads
-Ryu is standing still
	onMouseOver = Hover over Ryu, he shifts to his ready pose
	onMouseOUt = Ryu returns to standing still
-Click Ryu
	onClick = Ryu leans forward and throws a Hadouken, remains until click release
	onClickRelease = Ryu returns to ready pose
-x
	on "x" key being pressed Ryu assumes "looking cool" pose
	on "x" key released Ryu returns to ready pose

The Hadouken gif is stationary and I have to make it move across the screen.
Also, it needs a sound effect.
